Hi! My name is Chris Bloodsworth. I am ecstatic about software development and design, and having interesting discussions with awesome people.

I have a particular interest in compilers and programming languages.

A prettier looking portfolio of some of my best work is at https://cbloodsworth.github.io. Be sure to check it out!

I'm willing to work on just about anything if it means learning and collaborating with good people.

You can reach me via christopherbloodsworth@gmail.com
