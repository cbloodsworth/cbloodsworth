Hi! My name is Chris Bloodsworth. I am a computer science student with a minor in mathematics and my focus is software engineering.

I'm mainly proficient in C++, but I have experience with Java, Javascript and Python. I am using C++ in my university projects and leetcode exercises, but am branching out with Python study at freecodecamp.org. Additionally, I am developing a portfolio website in Javascript --- more on that to come!

I'm willing to work on just about anything if it means learning and collaborating with good people.

You can reach me via christopherbloodsworth@gmail.com
