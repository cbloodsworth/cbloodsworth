Hi! My name is Chris Bloodsworth. I am a computer science student with a minor in mathematics and I'm super passionate about software.

I generally am most excited about working on devtools / libraries, though I'm interested in learning about most areas of development.

I'm mainly proficient in C++ and Python, but I have experience with a number of other languages and tools. 
Python is cool if I want something made quick and effective, but there's something about the elegance of modern C++ that just feels perfect when done right ;)

A prettier looking portfolio of some of my best work is at https://cbloodsworth.github.io. Be sure to check it out!

I'm willing to work on just about anything if it means learning and collaborating with good people.

You can reach me via christopherbloodsworth@gmail.com
