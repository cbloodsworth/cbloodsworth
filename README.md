Hi! My name is Chris Bloodsworth. I am a computer science student with a minor in mathematics and my focus is software engineering.

I'm mainly proficient in C++, but I have experience with Java, Javascript, Python, and HTML/CSS. I am using C++ in my university projects and leetcode exercises, but am branching out with Python study at freecodecamp.org.

A prettier looking portfolio of some of my best work is at cbloodsworth.github.io. Be sure to check it out!

I'm willing to work on just about anything if it means learning and collaborating with good people.

You can reach me via christopherbloodsworth@gmail.com
